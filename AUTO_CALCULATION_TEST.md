# Testing Automatic Amount Calculation

## HOW TO TEST THE AUTO-CALCULATION FEATURE

**Visit: http://localhost:3000**

### ‚úÖ **STEP-BY-STEP TEST:**

1. **Connect Your Wallet**
   - Click "Connect Wallet"
   - Approve MetaMask connection
   - You should see all network balances

2. **Test Network Selection**
   - Click dropdown in "From" section ‚Üí Choose AVAX
   - Click dropdown in "To" section ‚Üí Choose ETH
   - You should see "Rate: 1 AVAX = 0.013500 ETH" appear

3. **Test Auto-Calculation**
   ```
   Type in From field: 1
   To field should show: 0.013500
   
   Type in From field: 10  
   To field should show: 0.135000
   
   Type in From field: 0.5
   To field should show: 0.006750
   ```

4. **Test Network Switching**
   - Change "From" dropdown to ETH
   - Change "To" dropdown to AVAX  
   - Rate should change to: "1 ETH = 74.000000 AVAX"
   - Type 1 in From ‚Üí should show 74.000000 in To

5. **Test Direction Swap**
   - Click the ‚Üï button
   - Networks should flip
   - Amounts should recalculate with new rate

### üîç **DEBUGGING TIPS:**

If auto-calculation isn't working:

1. **Check Browser Console** (Press F12)
   ```
   Look for these debug messages:
   - "Fetching exchange rate: {fromCurrency: 'AVAX', toCurrency: 'ETH'}"
   - "Setting exchange rate to: 0.0135"  
   - "From amount changed: 1"
   - "Calculating receive amount: {fromAmount: '1', exchangeRate: 0.0135}"
   - "Setting toAmount to: 0.013500"
   ```

2. **Check Network Selection**
   - Make sure you've selected different currencies (AVAX vs ETH)
   - Same currency won't trigger exchange rate calculation

3. **Refresh Page**
   - Sometimes React state needs a refresh
   - Try refreshing and reconnecting wallet

### üéØ **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:**

**When It's Working Correctly:**
- Type in "From" field ‚Üí "To" field updates instantly
- Change network dropdown ‚Üí rate updates, amounts recalculate
- Click swap direction ‚Üí everything flips and recalculates
- "To" field has gray background (read-only)
- Exchange rate shown below "To" field

**Current Exchange Rates (Hardcoded):**
- 1 AVAX = 0.0135 ETH
- 1 ETH = 74.0 AVAX

### üìù **TEST SCENARIOS:**

**Scenario 1: AVAX ‚Üí ETH**
```
From: [1.0] [‚ñ≤ AVAX]
To:   [0.013500] [‚óÜ ETH] (auto-calculated)
Rate: 1 AVAX = 0.013500 ETH
```

**Scenario 2: ETH ‚Üí AVAX**  
```
From: [0.01] [‚óÜ ETH]
To:   [0.740000] [‚ñ≤ AVAX] (auto-calculated)  
Rate: 1 ETH = 74.000000 AVAX
```

**Scenario 3: Same Currency (No Calculation)**
```
From: [1.0] [‚óÜ ETH]
To:   [1.000000] [‚óÜ ETH] (rate = 1:1)
Rate: 1 ETH = 1.000000 ETH
```

If the auto-calculation is working, you should see the "To" amount update immediately when you type in the "From" field, and the exchange rate should be displayed below the "To" section.
